# generate-illegible-addresses
A simple script that generates email addresses that are especially hard to read. Useful for personal online security.

Passwords can be somewhat secure but login email addresses tend to be fairly static. 
You can use services such as SimpleLogin to create a unique alias to obfuscate your identity but for critical services, I don't want to use any third parties just in case.
However I want my critical email address to be as hard as possible for an attacker to read, remember, spell out over the phone, etc.

So I quickly made this page to generate random email addresses using letters that are optically similar to each other.

Feel free to change the characters used and to increase/decrease the number of characters used.

The linked Github pages should be fairly safe to use since script is executed entirely by the browser, but please for your own safety:
- read the code before executing it locally.
- do not use the codes generated by the Github page, or use at your own risk.
- ensure that nobody is looking at your screen when generating addresses, again just to be on the safe side.
